# RCOS-Aligned Content Guide for the Blueprint Page

## Purpose of This File

This document instructs coding and content AIs on **how to update, rewrite, or extend the Blueprint page** so that it is fully aligned with **RCOS (Regenerative Community Operating System)**.

It serves two roles:
1. **Source of truth** about what RCOS is and how it should be explained.
2. **Editorial and tone guide** to ensure clarity, humility, and precision.

This file is authoritative for all AI-assisted changes to the Blueprint page.

## What RCOS Is (Source of Truth)

RCOS stands for **Regenerative Community Operating System**.

RCOS is **not software**, **not a DAO product**, and **not a fixed ideology**.

RCOS is:
- A **formal, open standard** for how communities are structured
- A **layered operating system** for community living
- A way to make communities **legible, testable, and improvable**
- A shared language for governance, membership, economy, conflict, operations, and evolution

RCOS defines:
- What must be explicit
- What may be optional
- What must never be implicit or informal

The **Blueprint** is the applied, human-facing name for RCOS during the transition phase.

When updating content:
- Treat **Blueprint** as the friendly term
- Treat **RCOS** as the formal name
- Make it clear they refer to the same thing

Example:
> The Blueprint, formally called RCOS (Regenerative Community Operating System), is an open standard for designing and operating regenerative communities.

## Core Structure of RCOS (Must Be Reflected)

RCOS is structured into **layers**, each with clear responsibility boundaries.

These layers must be referenced consistently and accurately.

### RCOS Core Layers

- **Layer 0: Purpose & Scope**
  Defines why the community exists, what is governed, and what invariants cannot be violated.

- **Layer 1: Membership**
  Defines how people join, participate, change status, and exit. No implicit membership.

- **Layer 2: Governance**
  Defines how decisions are made, who can decide what, and how authority is constrained.

- **Layer 3: Economy & Resources**
  Defines commons vs private resources, contribution recognition, internal economies, and treasury rules.

- **Layer 4: Conflict, Repair & Accountability**
  Defines how conflict is handled, escalated, repaired, and when separation is required.

- **Layer 5: Operations & Coordination**
  Defines roles, meetings, documentation, and workload boundaries.

- **Layer 6: Evolution & Adaptation**
  Defines how rules change, experiments run, and learning is captured without collapse.

The Blueprint page should:
- Reference these layers explicitly
- Avoid mixing them into vague categories like “culture” or “values”
- Emphasize that **structure comes before ideology**

---

## What the Blueprint Page Is For

The Blueprint page should explain:

- What RCOS is, in simple language
- Why structure matters in communities
- How RCOS helps communities avoid common failure modes
- That RCOS is modular and adaptable
- That communities can adopt it partially or fully

The Blueprint page should **not**:
- Explain every layer in full detail
- Read like legal documentation
- Contain implementation minutiae

It should act as:
- A conceptual map
- A trust-building overview
- An invitation to explore deeper documentation

---

## Modules: How to Explain Them

Modules are **optional extensions** that sit on top of the RCOS Core.

Modules:
- Do NOT change core invariants
- Do NOT override governance
- Apply RCOS to specific domains

Examples of modules:
- Permaculture
- Minimal Permaculture
- Education
- Housing
- Land Commons Safeguards
- Alternative Economies

How to describe modules:
> Modules extend RCOS into real-world domains like food systems, education, or land stewardship, without changing the core rules of the system.

Do NOT describe modules as:
- Required
- Ideological
- “The right way” to live

---

## Tone and Language Guidelines (Critical)

### Tone to Use

- Clear
- Grounded
- Humble
- Non-marketing
- Non-evangelical
- Precise but human

Preferred framing:
- “This helps make things explicit”
- “This reduces ambiguity”
- “This is one possible structure”
- “Communities adapt this to their context”

### Tone to Avoid

Avoid:
- Grandiose claims
- “World-changing” language
- Buzzwords
- Crypto hype
- Moral superiority

Do NOT say:
- “The future of humanity”
- “The only way”
- “Revolutionary system”
- “Disrupting everything”

---

## What to Say vs What Not to Say (Examples)

### Good Example

> RCOS helps communities make implicit assumptions explicit, so power, responsibility, and conflict do not drift into informal hierarchies.

### Bad Example

> RCOS guarantees harmony and eliminates conflict.

---

### Good Example

> The Blueprint is designed to be adapted. Communities can adopt parts of it and evolve their implementation over time.

### Bad Example

> Communities must fully implement the Blueprint to succeed.

---

### Good Example

> Conflict is treated as a normal condition with defined pathways.

### Bad Example

> RCOS prevents conflict.

---

## DAO Terminology Guidance

If the term “DAO” appears on the Blueprint page:

- Assume many readers do not understand it
- Always explain it on first use
- Prefer human language over crypto framing

Acceptable explanation:
> DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), meaning a rule-based organization where authority is defined by agreed processes rather than hierarchy.

Avoid:
- Token talk
- Blockchain technical details
- Financial speculation framing

---

## Structural Priorities for the Blueprint Page

When reorganizing or expanding the page, prioritize in this order:

1. Purpose of RCOS
2. Why structure matters in communities
3. RCOS Layers overview
4. Modules and adaptability
5. Stress tests and real-world validation
6. Invitation to explore or contribute

Do NOT start with:
- Tools
- Technology
- Ideology
- Vision statements without structure

---

## Stress Tests and Realism

If referencing stress tests:

- Frame them as learning tools
- Emphasize failure modes, not perfection
- Show RCOS as something tested against reality

Example:
> RCOS includes stress tests based on real community failures, such as informal power accumulation or conflict avoidance.

---

## Final Instruction to AI Agents

When updating the Blueprint page:

- Always prefer clarity over persuasion
- Always make authority explicit
- Always separate structure from values
- Always assume readers are intelligent but cautious
- Never imply RCOS replaces human judgment

If unsure:
- Reduce claims
- Add clarity
- Make assumptions explicit

RCOS exists to reduce ambiguity, not to replace people.
