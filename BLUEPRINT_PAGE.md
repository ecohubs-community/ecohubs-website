1. Hero — The Blueprint for Regenerative Communities

Goal
Immediately answer: What is the Blueprint and why does it matter?

Core message
This is not content. It’s infrastructure for rebuilding community knowledge.

Key points
- A shared, evolving blueprint for building EcoHubs
- Digital, open, and grounded in practice
- Designed for replication, not perfection

Layout / Interaction
- Strong headline + subline
- Subtle animated diagram hinting at “Domains → Modules → Articles”
- Gentle motion on scroll (fade + translate)
- Primary CTA: Explore the Blueprint
- Secondary CTA: Contribute

2. The Problem — Lost Knowledge, Rising Complexity

Goal
Explain why the blueprint is necessary — historically and now.

Core message
Community knowledge wasn’t destroyed — it fragmented and failed to scale.

Narrative points
- Community living knowledge used to be local and implicit
- Modern life is more complex, interconnected, regulated
- Communities today fail repeatedly on the same issues:
- governance
- conflict
- economics
- burnout
- unclear ownership
- Reinventing everything locally no longer works

Layout / Interaction
- Split layout:
- Left: short narrative text
- Right: animated “loop of failure” (same problems recurring)
- On hover or scroll: problems highlight cyclically
- Tone: calm, honest, non-accusatory

3. The Idea — A Shared Foundation for Many Communities

Goal
Introduce the blueprint as the missing connective tissue.

Core message
Independent communities need a shared foundation to scale without losing autonomy.

Key ideas
- Not one perfect model
- A common structure + shared values
- Freedom to adapt locally
- Coordination without centralization

Layout / Interaction
- Visual comparison:
- “Isolated Communities” → fragmented, fragile
- “Networked Communities” → resilient, learning system
- Animate connections forming between hubs
- Light parallax or node animations

4. What the Blueprint Is (and Isn’t)

Goal
Remove misconceptions and position it clearly.

What it IS
- A living knowledge system
- Modular and adaptable
- Versioned and reviewable
- Grounded in real-world experiments

What it IS NOT
- A rigid rulebook
- A utopian manifesto
- A top-down authority
- A finished product

Layout / Interaction
- Two-column “Is / Is Not” cards
- Subtle hover states
- Icons + concise statements
- Clean, readable, confident

5. Structure — How the Blueprint Is Organized

Goal
Make the system tangible and understandable.

Explain the hierarchy
- Domains → Topics → Modules → Articles
- Each level answers a different question
- Designed for navigation, reuse, and iteration

Domains examples
- Governance
- Food systems
- Infrastructure
- Economy
- Culture
- Education
- (Expandable)

Layout / Interaction
- Layered vertical or stacked diagram
- Click / hover expands layers
- Highlight relationships between domains
- Animated transitions between levels

6. How It’s Built — From Theory to Practice (and Back)

Goal
Show this is rigorous, iterative, and real.

Process
	1.	Ideas emerge from practice
	2.	Articles are proposed
	3.	Reviewed collaboratively
	4.	Tested in real hubs
	5.	Improved or discarded
	6.	Knowledge evolves

Key tools
- GitHub for versioning & review
- Custom app for collaboration
- Structured contribution workflows

Layout / Interaction
- Circular flow diagram (loop, not linear)
- Soft animated arrows
- Each step highlights on hover
- Emphasize feedback loops

7. Why This Matters — Preventing Failure Before It Happens

Goal
Make the value unmistakable.

Benefits
- Reduce repeated mistakes
- Faster learning cycles
- Shared memory across hubs
- Lower barrier to starting
- More resilient communities

Layout / Interaction
- Metrics-style cards (without fake numbers)
- Before / after mental models
- Calm, confident tone

⸻

8. How You Can Use the Blueprint

Goal
Show practical entry points for different users.

Use cases
- Starting a new EcoHub
- Improving an existing community
- Research & education
- Governance redesign
- Conflict prevention

Layout / Interaction
- Persona-based cards
- Hover reveals “What you’ll find”
- Optional deep links to blueprint sections

⸻

9. How to Contribute — Build the Future Together

Goal
Turn readers into contributors.

Ways to contribute
- Write or improve articles
- Review and discuss
- Document experiments
- Propose new domains or modules

Access
- Publicly readable
- Member-only contributions
- Clear contribution pathways

Layout / Interaction
- Step-by-step contributor flow
- GitHub + App clearly explained
- CTA: Apply for Access / Start Contributing

10. Call to Action — This Is a Long-Term Project

Goal
Anchor expectations and invite commitment.

Message
- This is generational work
- Built slowly, carefully, together
- Designed to outlive its creators

Layout / Interaction
- Minimalist closing section
- Strong typography
- Soft background gradient
- One clear CTA

Overall Design Notes:
- Calm, confident, non-hype tone
- Organic motion (no sharp animations)
- Emphasis on loops, layers, and networks
- Consistent iconography
- Space to breathe — clarity over density
- needs to fit optically to current pages
- use interactivity and animations to support content visually or interactively

Tech:
- svelte 5 (with runes)
- tailwind 4
- svelte animations
- use <Section> component
- Icons: Iconify and tabler package
- Extract/reuse repeating content components
- Use data arrays for repeating contents
